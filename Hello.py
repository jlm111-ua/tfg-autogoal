        AutoGOAL is a Python library for automatically finding the best way to solve a given task. 
        It has been designed mainly for Automated Machine Learning (aka AutoML) but it can be used 
        in any scenario where you have several possible ways to solve a given task.

        Technically speaking, AutoGOAL is a framework for program synthesis, i.e., 
        finding the best program to solve a given problem, provided that the user can describe the space of all possible programs. 
        AutoGOAL provides a set of low-level components to define different spaces and efficiently search in them. 
        In the specific context of machine learning, AutoGOAL also provides high-level components that can be used as a black-box in almost any type of problem and dataset format.
